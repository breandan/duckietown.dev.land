# About

Duckietown (duckietown.mit.edu) was originally developed at MIT as a class on advanced autonomy [[**MIT 2.166**](http://duckietown.mit.edu)].
It is a hands-on, project-focused course focusing on self-driving vehicles and high-level autonomy.

The class focuses on solving the ultimate problem to 
**Design an Autonomous Robo-Taxi System for the City of Duckietown.**

This project ([duckietown.dev.land](http://duckietown.dev.land)) is an attempt to extend
the **City of Duckietown** and open its doors to Middle School students.
